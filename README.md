# Square Deposit IDs

Square deposit reports contain each transaction for the given period. Fees are only taken for credit card transactions so if a purchase contains a split payment with cash, it doesn't provide that data.

This program calculates a *Card Collected* column for each deposit. 

Square deposit file should begin with: "deposit-details-"

You can get the same data from logging into your Square account or programmatically via the Square API, but this is for small business owners who need access to the data without having to manually click through each day or hire a programmer.

A small executable file is located here(https://www.dropbox.com/s/st5w07tjb8ks9c6/squareccdeposits.app.zip).

**Note**: Only for MacOS. Tested on High Sierra.
