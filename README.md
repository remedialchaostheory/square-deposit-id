# Square Deposit IDs

Square deposit reports contain each transaction for the given period. Fees are only taken for credit card transactions so if a purchase contains a split payment with cash, it doesn't provide that data.

This program calculates a *Card Collected* column for each deposit.

The result can be programmatically done via the Square API or viewed online, but this is for small business owners who need access to the data without having to click through each day.

A small executable file is located here(https://www.dropbox.com/s/st5w07tjb8ks9c6/squareccdeposits.app.zip).

**Note**: Only for MacOS. Tested on High Sierra.
